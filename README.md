# Home page template for chrome new tab

Very basic template for chrome new tab. Still WIP. It uses bulma.css and 
fontawesome icons.

I use [new tab redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) 
to redirect new tab to my html on my pc.

I can not seem to find a native way of doing this in chrome. 
Yes you can change the home icon click event landing page but not new tab one.

Here is a demo which will have many more features soon with font awesome 
icons and stuff:
